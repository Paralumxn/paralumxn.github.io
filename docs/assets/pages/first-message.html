                    Do you still remember our first time meeting each other?
                    Do you still remember the time when I said that I liked you? 
                    Do you still remember the time when I said that I needed you? 
                    That I love you? That I will always be there when you need me?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I think about you, remember you, or dream about you, it hurts me a lot, 
                    like I got shot by a gun. Your memories still hunt me, and <u class="hiddenMessage" onclick="hiddenMessage()">I'm afraid</u> that maybe it will be the reason for my death.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm sorry if I am the reason for your death. I don't mean holding you until your last breath. I just can't let you go until the end.
                    Years have passed by and I still miss you and love you. Even though I see a lot of other people around me, I still choose you until we meet again.
