                    Hey, it's been a year without you and guess what? 
                    I'm still suffering from all of this. I want you to come back now, 
                    but when? Or should I go to you? I wanted to suffer more with my mental health, 
                    but you saved me, and guess what? I'm now more suffering and I always feel guilty because of this. 
                    You made me like this. I want <u class="hiddenMessage" onclick="hiddenMessage()">to be with you</u> now again. I want to repay all of your sacrifices to make my life longer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm not mad because I suffer a lot without you, but I am mad because of my guilt. 
                    I feel guilty about leaving you and not delivering you to the hospital where I waited until your last breath came. 
                    I miss you so much, but until when should I feel like this?
